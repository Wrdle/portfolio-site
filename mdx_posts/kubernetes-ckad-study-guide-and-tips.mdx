excerpt: The CKAD is an extremely beneficial but difficult exam. Having done the CKAD in the past year, I recap the resources I used and tips I recommend.

The CKAD exam is a fantastic way to achieve a deep understanding of Kubernetes and container orchestration. In fact,
for myself this was the exact reason why I pursued it only a few months out of university.

For me, in my job we host a lot all of our applications within Kubernetes, however, I found myself mostly out of my
depth or constantly googling answers to common knowledge. By studying for the CKAD and following online courses, I
found I quickly was able to perform my job better and to a highly quality standard bringing knowledge into our team
other seniors did not even have!

## What will you learn?
The exam curriculum is broken down five Kubernetes domains:
- Application Design and Build
- Application Deployment
- Application Observability
- Application Environment, Configuration and Security
- Services and networking

Each domain corresponds to different Kubernetes concepts and ways of thinking with questions designed to quiz you
on how well you can bring these ideas from different domains together. Overall, by completing the CKAD one could expect
you to be able to take a given application, containerize it, create pod configuration for it, configure its deployment
strategy, create application configuration through config maps, setup health checks and setup networking. Basically
everything you need to take any app and put it in a cluster! Very practical!

By studying for the exam you learn all of these concepts following official Kubernetes best practices and learning how
to properly utilize official Kubernetes technologies and services such as Helm deployments.

## Training material
Okay, so you want to do the exam, but where to start? To study for my exam I reviewed a wide variety of resources
to gain a deep understanding of the ecosystem. As awesome Kubernetes is, there's a lot to it, so finding good study
material is a must!

Full disclosure I receive no benefits for mentioning or recommending any of the following study material. These are
resources I actually used and found useful!

### Udemy - CKAD course by Mumshad Mannambeth
Throughout my study, this is probably the resource I found the most useful. This video course on Udemy by Mumshad
Mannambeth covers all topics the exam contains from A-z broken down into small bite-sized videos that are well explained
that make it easy to understanding difficult concepts.

What's really nice about this course is it comes included with access to interactive labs provided by KodeKloud. These
labs were extremely useful as they provide an environment in which you can practice using the `kubectl` on a real
temporary cluster which is automatically torn down at the end of the exercise. This means no accidental costs of leaving
a cluster running in AWS or the like! Not to mention, being a fully integrated learning platform, at the end of the
exercise the website checks you have followed the instruction and completed the exercise correctly, very important for
the exam!

### Website - Cloud Academy
Cloud academy similar to KodeKloud provides a temporary cluster environment in which you are able to complete exercises
that teach and test your Kubernetes knowledge. The website also couples these practical exercises with videos and written
articles that explain concepts.

Overall I found Cloud Academy to be a great secondary study resource that I used to solidify knowledge I learnt form
Mumshad's course and KodeKloud. I found most concepts to be better explained through Mumshads course and sometimes to
further detail too. Similarly, the lab exercises were more 'clunky' requiring the user to enter an AWS console and ssh
into an EC2 instance, which could be a bit cumbersome. Nevertheless, I would still recommend subscribing for a month
before you take the exam to be able to review their material as a "solidifier" and to be able to access their practice
exams.

### Book - Certified Kubernetes Application Developer Study Guide
This is probably one of the best resources if you prefer to read as your study method! The Certified Kubernetes
Application Developer Study Guide book by O'Reilly is s great in depth guide to understanding Kubernetes. Personally I
did not find myself reading this book from front to cover, but I did find it a useful guide for understanding complicated
concepts like ingresses in more detail. In fact, I still find myself returning to this book, whenever I need a in-depth
refresher on a particular concept.

## Practice Exams
So you have been doing online labs, maybe you have read a few books, but it's time to start preparing for the exam!
Luckily, there are many online practice exams for the CKAD exam, however, I'm in this section, I am only going to
discuss the practice exam material I used to pass my exam.

### KodeKloud and Cloud Academy
Earlier in this article, I mentioned both Cloud Academy and KodeKloud as great a great resource for online labs. But they
both also offer multiple realistic practise exams that are timed and automatically graded. In fact, if you have purchased
Mumshads course you don't really need anything else as I found these practise exams to be very broad and accurate to the
harder questions on the real exam.

However, if you still find yourself not completely confident (like I did), for extra practise, I would also highly
recommend purchasing a one-month subscription to CloudAcademy before sitting your exam. Personally, I found the exams to
have different questions to KloudAcademy but equal difficulty. Completing both of these sets of practise
exams multiple times got me back into the habit of sitting exams and exam time management (I don't miss those uni exams ðŸ˜…),
which is important considering the nature of the exam.

### Killer.sh
Upon purchasing your CKAD exam you will actually receive two free sessions to Killer.sh. USE THEM!  Going into the Killer.sh practise exam I was
expecting a similar level of difficulty to the exams I had completed on KodeKloud and CloudAcademy. So I was taken by
surprise when I found myself unable to breeze through the questions barely passing the practise exam.

So I googled around and discovered many people reporting that this exam is a lot harder than the real CKAD exam.
After sitting my actual CKAD exam, I can also report this is true! The real CKAD exam is broken up into questions of
multiple difficulties that are all weighted differently. However, the Killer.sh practise exam is more equivalent to ONLY
getting the most difficult questions in the same exam time periods. Because of this alone I would highly reccomend
anyone sitting the CKAD exam to use their Killer.sh practise exams. If you can confidently do these practise exams you
can be confident you are ready to sit the real thing!

## Tips and Tricks
Choosing the correcting learning resources and practise exams is pretty simple considering the wealth of quality content.
However, there are also some tips and tricks listed here that I believe are almost necessary to successfully completing the
CKAD exam.

### Learn to use the Linux CLI
No one wants to hear it, especially if you are not a linux wizard (I'm definitely not). Learning how to use the Linux CLI
and the common commands bundled with most distros can be the difference between finishing all the questions on the exams
or running out of time. I'd recommend at least learning popular CLI commands like `grep`, `tail`, `jq` and `wc`. These
commands can help you find things and debug outputs from kubectl quickly during the exam. Not to mention, because
foundational linux is a pre-requisite to the exam, there is nothing stopping them from slipping in a question that
requires you to use basic commands in order to complete the question.

### Learn to use Kubectl fast and effectively
During your exam, you won't have time to write out entire yaml configuration files to answer the questions. Instead,
its' important to have a good proficiency in the imperative kubectl commands like `kubectl create`. This paired with
`--dry-run=client` and `-o yaml` you can quickly generate yaml config files that you can edit without needing to write
 it out yourself.

One command in particular that is generally forgotten about is the `kubectl explain` command, which can provide in-depth
explanations of every field for a given Kubernetes object. This is extremely useful during the exam if you have
forgotten the spec or syntax for a particular object or property and just need a reference.
